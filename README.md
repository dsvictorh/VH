My personal website/portfolio

This project is my personal web page where I expose the personal and/or public projects I work on. The layout is designed by myself. The more complex parts like images and logos are designed by my sister and personal designer Stephanie Herrera.

Of course some files have sensitive data so the .example files are created instead to template the expected behavior.
