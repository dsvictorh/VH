				<h3>About Me</h3>

				<p>I&rsquo;m Victor Herrera, a software engineer and web developer with a love for simplistic yet amazing web solutions and the world of video game development. Though I could just describe to you my experience and knowledge I honestly think that&rsquo;s what my <a href="http://cr.linkedin.com/in/dsvictorh" target="_blank">LinkedIn Profile</a> is for, which you are more than welcome to check out. Instead I&rsquo;d rather describe myself as a person and a little bit of what it means to be me as a professional.<p>

				<p>Over the years I have found myself caring to learn about the visual concept of my projects, some people have the wrong idea that as developers we are a bit &ldquo;square&rdquo;, but I think we are creative beings beyond the uderstanding of so many, and we can still be the logical geniuses they see us as. I believe this way of seeing yourself as a developer makes an interesting combination towards delivering only the best solutions and giving all your care to the project you are creating.</p>

				<p>As a developer I understand the idea of teamwork and embrace it completely. But as my personality goes, sometimes I do my best work alone to a certain point to then integrate it with the group. This requires a lot of self-management and the ability to keep myself motivated. I don&rsquo;t believe on leaving things in the middle, I either get there or die trying.</p>

				<p>As any person I&rsquo;m not perfect and it is always my goal to grow in a positive way as a professional as well as a human being. Self-constructive criticism is one of the things I always see as completely necessary for a healthy work environment and personal growth.</p>

				<p>Last but not least...at all, as a hardcore gamer I&rsquo;ve always found a deep interest in being part of a game development company and even expand my abilities from web development to game development along the way. I&rsquo;ve admire gaming companies my whole life not only as the best set of developers/designers/animators/administrative teams, because I really don&rsquo;t think there is a more complex piece of art than a game, but also as the most caring and creative group of people you can be a part of, and I dream of being a part of the joy brought to millions of players from a world they could never even imagine if it wasn&rsquo;t for the people behind these amazing projects. My dream is to be a part of the adventure these companies take you on.</p>

						<h3>My Work</h3>

						<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;ve worked a lot in private and/or internal projects so there might not be a lot in here to show for now, but I do intend to work on some personal things to have more to show along the way. Still, I think this website is perfectly capable of showing my skills, and the mobile version will be coming soon. Second, everything you find here as little as it is I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re gonna love it. So take a look, I think you&rsquo;ll find some interesting work:</p>
