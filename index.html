					<h3>About Me</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I could just post my years of experience and the technologies I know but frankly that&rsquo;s what <a href="http://cr.linkedin.com/in/dsvictorh" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> is for. I&rsquo;d rather make a little paragraph of each part of what it means to be me as a professional.<p>

				<p>My experience in web development over the years has led me to a deep understanding on UI/UX, which strangely is my expertise even though my formation is as a Software Engineer. I believe it makes an interesting and rather rare combination. I know most developers won&rsquo;t like hearing this but the truth is people label us as &ldquo;square&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m just here to prove them wrong. If anything we are creative beings beyond everyone&rsquo;s understanding.</p>

				<p>As a developer I understand the idea of teamwork and embrace it completely. But as my personality goes I do my best work alone to a certain point to then integrate it with the group which requires a lot of self-management and the ability to keep myself motivated. I don&rsquo;t believe on leaving things in the middle, I either get there or die trying.</p>

				<p>As any person I&rsquo;m not perfect and it is always my goal to grow in a positive way as a professional as well as a human being. Self-constructive criticism is one of the things I always see as completely necessary for a healthy work environment and personal growth.</p>

				<p>Last but not least...at all, as a hardcore gamer I&rsquo;ve always found a deep interest in being part of a game development company and even expand my abilities from web development to game development along the way. I&rsquo;ve admire gaming companies my whole life not only as the best set of developers/designers/animators/administrative teams, because I really don&rsquo;t think there is a more complex piece of art than a game, but also as the most caring and creative group of people you can be a part of, and I dream of being a part of the joy brought to millions of players from a world they could never even imagine if it wasn&rsquo;t for the people behind these amazing projects. My dream is to be a part of the adventure these companies take you on.</p>

						<h3>My Work</h3>
					</header>
					<p>To be honest I&rsquo;ve worked a lot in private and/or internal projects so there might not be a lot in here to show. First, I think this website is perfectly capable of showing my skills, I even designed it myself and asked my personal designer and sister <a href="http://stephanieherreraart.com" target="_blank">Stephanie Herrera</a> to help me with the character images and logo (great work right there, it&rsquo;s what brings the site alive). Second, everything you find here as little as it is I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not gonna like it...You&rsquo;re gonna LOVE IT. So take a look, I think you&rsquo;ll find some interesting work:</p>
